# Short term memory game
I created this game using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
It shows 8 cards after you press the start button , when the cards dissappear you have to use your arrays buttons on the keyboard to guess the cards.
<Strong> YOU CAN DOWNLOAD A VIDEO THAT EXPLAIN THE GAME, it is called memory video.mp4<Strong>
